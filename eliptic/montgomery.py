# for the montgomery curve given as By^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + x over some field K
# TODO: implement addition and doubling 

# alternatively you can convert the curve to Weierstrass -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_curve#:~:text=.-,Equivalence%20with%20Weierstrass%20curves,-%5Bedit%5D
# and then use the Weierstrass formulas for addition and doubling
